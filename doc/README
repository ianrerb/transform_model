All of this product's content was created by Ian Erb, with the exception of the sp_gamma.h file, which was created by Behzad Nouri.

NOTE*** This product requires downloading and installing fftw plugin available at http://www.fftw.org/

Installation Instructions:
Extract the transform_model folder into your home directory
Navigate inside the transform_model directory
run 'make'

RUNNING AN INSTANCE OF THE PRICING ENGINE:
All inputs to the Model are specified in .trial files (format explained below) and placed in the trials/ directory 
Run a single trial file <file_name> using the following command in the transform_model directory:

./main trials/<file_name>

The results are written to the transform_model/results/ directory in the file 
<file_name>.out

For instance, in the transform_model directory enter
./main trials/FFT_GBM_1.trial

The results would then be written to results/FFT_GBM_1.trial.out

RUNNING BATCH FILES:
Execute the command 'make run' in the transform_model directory to batch process all files in the inputs/ directory

FORMATTING .input FILES:

A .input file has markup-style formatting and contains 3 mandatory nodes: CONTRACT, MODEL, ENGINE
The general layout of a .input file is: 

<CONTRACT>
  Type: { call, put }
  Spot: { double }
  Strike: { double }*
</CONTRACT>

<MODEL>
  name: { GBM, VarianceGamma, Heston, CGMY }
  rate: { double }
  dividend: { double }
  T: { double }

  sigma: { double }?
  kappa: { double }?
  theta: { double }?
  rho: { double }?
  init_vol: { double numeric }?
  nu: { double }?
  C: { double }?
  G: { double }?
  M: { double }?
  Y: { double }?
</MODEL>

<ENGINE>
  name: { FFT, FrFFT, COS }
  N: { unsigned int }*
  alpha: { double }*
  eta: { double }?
  bound: { double double }*
  lambda: { double }*
</ENGINE>

Each file may contain more specifications than necessary for a 
given Engine or Model Type, and the added specs will not affect the model.
